        <h2>Hi there—I'm the voice behind Record-mendations!</h2>

        <p>Music has always been more than just sound to me—it’s a dynamic, evolving soundtrack to every phase of life.
            From the power of a soaring musical arrangement to the timeless charm of a vinyl classic, or the evocative
            emotional depth of a film score, I find immense joy in exploring how artists weave stories through
            sound.</p>
        <p>Record-mendations was born out of a deep passion for sharing this joy. As an aspiring graphic designer with a
            lifelong love for the arts—spanning drawing, design, and music—I’ve always been fascinated by how creativity
            crosses boundaries. Over the years, I’ve explored countless albums across genres and eras, always chasing
            those unique moments that make an album stand out. This platform is my way of sharing those
            discoveries—albums that resonated with me and may strike a chord with you, too.
        </p>

        <b>The albums I feature are grouped into four categories, each reflecting different aspects of my musical
            taste:</b>

        <p><strong>Modern:</strong> Contemporary music from recent decades, including alternative, indie, pop, and
            experimental.</p>
        <p><strong>Oldies:</strong> Timeless classics from the golden age of music, spanning rock, soul, jazz, and more
            from the '50s through the '80s.</p>
        <p><strong>Film:</strong> Soundtracks and scores that elevate their movies, from sweeping orchestral
            compositions to modern cinematic hits.</p>
        <p><strong>Musicals:</strong> Broadway and West End favorites, movie musicals, and cast albums that bring
            stories to life through song.</p>

        <p>Each album includes a short write-up, as well as my top three favorite tracks—personal highlights that I
            believe are worth your time.</p>
        <p>I created this site for anyone who’s ever fallen in love with an album and wanted to share that excitement.
            Whether you’re a casual listener or a passionate music lover, Record-mendations is designed to help you
            discover new sounds, rediscover old favorites, or reconnect with the joy that music brings. I hope you’ll
            find something that resonates deeply with you, just as music has always done for me.</p>

        <b>Thank you for visiting—and happy listening!</b>
