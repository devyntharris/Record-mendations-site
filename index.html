    <h1>Welcome to Record-mendations</h1>
    <h2>—your curated guide to discovering new music through thoughtful, personal album recommendations.</h2>
    <p>
        Every review on this site is written by me—an avid music enthusiast and aspiring graphic designer with a deep
        appreciation for storytelling through sound. My goal is to connect the dots between music, emotion, and
        creativity, offering a fresh perspective on albums that have impacted me deeply and may resonate with you too.
    </p>

    <b>This site features handpicked album recommendations, categorized into four main genres:</b>

    <p><strong>Modern:</strong> Contemporary releases spanning various styles, from indie and pop to alternative and
        beyond.</p>
    <p><strong>Oldies:</strong> Timeless classics, primarily from the '50s through the '80s, that shaped the music
        landscape.</p>
    <p><strong>Film:</strong> Scores and soundtracks that bring cinematic moments to life.</p>
    <p><strong>Musicals:</strong> Original cast recordings and standout albums from Broadway, West End, and movie
        adaptations.</p>

    <b>Each album review includes:</b>

    <ul>
        <li>Album Artwork & Spotify Link: An image of the album cover, prominently displayed. When you click on the
            image, it will take you directly to the album's Spotify page for easy access. This feature ensures that you
            can instantly immerse yourself in the music with just a click.
        </li>

        <li>Top 3 Tracks: My personal favorite tracks from the album, chosen based on their impact on the album’s flow
            and their emotional or musical resonance. These selections are deeply influenced by what stands out most to
            me as a listener, and I hope they offer insight into why these songs are memorable.
        </li>

        <li>Album Overview: A brief summary of the album’s sound, mood, and overall impact, covering its musical style,
            emotional tone, and influence. I’ll explore how the album resonates within its genre, its relevance to
            current trends, and why it stands out as a noteworthy listening experience.
        </li>
    </ul>
